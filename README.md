AI-Driven Maps for an Immersive Tourism Experience 

The tourism industry is evolving with a growing demand for personalized and immersive travel experiences. Current digital tools, while effective, often fall short in delivering dynamic and context-aware solutions. This project, titled "AI-Driven Maps for an Immersive Tourism Experience," proposes integrating artificial intelligence and augmented reality to address these gaps. The AI-powered system will deliver personalized recommendations, optimized routes, and real-time updates based on user preferences, traffic, and environmental factors. AR features will enhance engagement by overlaying cultural, historical, and contextual information onto maps. By combining machine learning, real-time data integration, and interactive design, the platform aims to redefine how travelers explore and experience new destinations, ensuring seamless, enriching, and adaptive journeys.

Functional Requirements:-

User Account Management: Allow users to create, edit, and manage profiles, including preferences for types of attractions, cuisines, and    travel modes.
Personalized Recommendations: Use machine learning to suggest points of interest (POIs) such as cultural sites, restaurants, and adventure spots based on user preferences.
Route Optimization: Calculate eﬃcient travel routes based on real-time traﬃc, distance, and user preferences. Provide multiple options like fastest, scenic, or cultural routes.
Interactive Map Features: Zoomable, scrollable, and interactive map interface to explore destinations. Highlight important locations with rich tooltips or pop-ups containing detailed information.
Itinerary Planning: Allow users to plan and save their travel itinerary with time-optimized schedules.
