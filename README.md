AI-Driven Maps for an Immersive Tourism Experience 

The tourism industry is evolving with a growing demand for personalized and immersive travel experiences. Current digital tools, while effective, often fall short in delivering dynamic and context-aware solutions. This project, titled "AI-Driven Maps for an Immersive Tourism Experience," proposes integrating artificial intelligence and augmented reality to address these gaps. The AI-powered system will deliver personalized recommendations, optimized routes, and real-time updates based on user preferences, traffic, and environmental factors. AR features will enhance engagement by overlaying cultural, historical, and contextual information onto maps. By combining machine learning, real-time data integration, and interactive design, the platform aims to redefine how travelers explore and experience new destinations, ensuring seamless, enriching, and adaptive journeys.
